I'm a Researcher and a Teaching Fellow at Ashoka University. Currently, my research interests lie in applied cryptography, specifically in designing and implementing protocols that are compatible with existing network infrastructure such as TLS. My supervisor is [Mahavir Jhawar](https://sites.google.com/site/homeofmahavir/Home).

I have worked as a software engineer for a major part of my small professional career. Previously, I worked at [Amuse Labs](https://amuselabs.com/) under [Sudheendra Hangal](http://xenon.stanford.edu/~hangal/) and at [SALT](https://www.salt.pe/), a Y Combinator-backed startup. I have also co-founded two startups &mdash; [Beyond Design Studio](https://beyonddesignstudio.com/) and Jaan Pehchan.

### working as a researcher:
For my undergraduate thesis, I developed a new anonymous credential protocol that works with standard protocols like TLS and SMTP to allow employees to anonymously prove their membership in an organization when exposing wrongdoing. This builds on prior work by Wang et al. on [blind certificate authorities](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/1022), which addressed the challenge employees face in providing proof to journalists without risking retaliation. My protocol reduces computation and implementation costs while still enabling anonymous proof generation. The work is currently under conference submission.

I recently began working on post-quantum cryptography under my supervisor. We are developing a secure communication system resilient to quantum computing attacks. Specifically, we are building a post-quantum key distribution framework to securely share encryption keys. Our project combines standard and post-quantum encryption for maximum security.
