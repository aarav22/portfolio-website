I'm a Researcher and a Teaching Fellow at Ashoka University. Currently, my research interests lie in applied cryptography, specifically in designing and implementing protocols that are compatible with existing network infrastructure such as TLS. My supervisor is [Mahavir Jhawar](https://sites.google.com/site/homeofmahavir/Home).

I have worked as a software engineer for a major part of my small professional career. Previously, I worked at [Amuse Labs](https://amuselabs.com/) under [Sudheendra Hangal](http://xenon.stanford.edu/~hangal/) and at [SALT](https://www.salt.pe/), a Y Combinator-backed startup. I have also co-founded two startups &mdash; [Beyond Design Studio](https://beyonddesignstudio.com/) and Jaan Pehchan.

### working as a researcher:
I undertook my undergraduate thesis on anonymous credential systems, starting with my review of [Blind Certificate Authorities](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/1022) by Wang et al. This paper addresses a challenge that employees face when exposing their organisation's wrongdoing to external journalists, where the journalist requires proof of the employee's membership in the organisation. However, the employee risks retaliation if they share their identity. Wang et al. provide a solution by presenting an anonymous way of generating proof using standard protocols like TLS (a way to establish a secure channel between a user and the server) and SMTP (used for sending and receiving email messages over the internet). I then developed a new protocol that works with these standard protocols but reduces computation costs and implementation effort while generating anonymous proof. *This work is currently under a conference submission.*

Recently, I began working in post-quantum cryptography with my supervisor. Our project is focused on developing a secure communication system that can withstand attacks from quantum computers, which have the potential to break traditional cryptographic systems. Specifically, we are building a post-quantum key distribution framework to securely distribute encryption keys among communicating parties. Our project combines standard and post-quantum encryption to ensure maximum robustness and security.
